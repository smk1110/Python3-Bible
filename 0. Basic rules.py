#Python is the programing language that is practical and easy.
#In this chapter, we'll learn:
#   Comments
#   print

#You can make string or number appear on console with 'print'.
print("Hello world!")
print(5)
#You can print variables (explained in the next chapter)

#Comments is used when you want to leave a message in source code.
#Interpreter(program that translates codes into computer's language) don't translate those sentenses and just pass away.

#You can leave comments by putting a # in front of the line like this.

'''If you
